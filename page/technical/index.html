<h1>Technical</h1>

<p>This section assumes some technical knowledge which may inlude a working knowledge of PHP, directory structures, HTML and so on.  However, if you are not familiar with these terms, it is still worth a read, as the technical details end up influencing the less technical details. So the question "Why can't I...", or "Why is...", may be better informed by what is going on here.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>One change that developed out of the idea to create a standardized directory structure was how to prefix constants so that various platforms could use them, rather than just their own method of defining constants. As WordPress was developed over the years it appears that their was not consistent way to name constants. That is, they are not all prefixed with <code>WP_</code>. This means that, when creating a list of all the constants used, it is difficult--if not impossible--to determine which are generate by WordPress and which aren't. In contrast, a number of plugins that were examined showed that they <em>did</em> attach a prefix to all of their plugins. This distinction is important because PHP comes with a large number of constants already, so it is necessary to determine which are generated by WordPress and which aren't.</p>

<p>In thinking over which prefix to use that could be used in a generic sense, for various platforms (including WordPress), the prefix <code>SITE_</code> was deemed suitable. That is, it was generic, not already used anywhere by WordPress and so could be used for the site as a whole. It was short enough, only four characters long, but a complete word, and not an abbreviation. Thus it has been used to set up a group of constants that can be used by WordPress to generate <em>its</em> internal constants, as well as a simple three file platform that is being called by the name "Dragonfly".</p>

<p>In fact, this relatively simple step cleared up a whole host of problems with WordPress and enabled the use of the "Dragonfly" platform almost as is. A major problem in having code access static files is <em>where</em> those static files are in relation to the code performing the task. At our disposal, we have what is called the <code>PATH</code> which can be obtained (strangely enough) from the special constant <code>__DIR__</code>. When <code>__DIR__</code> is echoed, it outputs then entire path, from the root of the server.</p>

<h2>Required</h2>

<p>While WordPress is a great starting point for many projects, because of its popularity and the wide range of plugins available, one area in which it falls short is its ability to integrate <em>required</em> features. That is, it <em>does</em> have a default plugin folder name called <code>mu-plugins</code>. However, the prefix "mu" is ambiguous, in my opinion. Also, the PHP naming standard discourages the use of abrreviations for both function names and classes. One could easily extend this to folder names. It says for functions, "Abbreviations should not be used when they greatly decrease the readability of the function name itself" and for class names, "Avoid using abbreviations where possible." Since "mu" is an abbreviation of "must-use", this use is discouraged by the PHP naming conventions. Also, "mu" is close in look and sound to "ms" which is <em>also</em> used in the WordPres core to refer to "multi-site". Thus there may be inherent confusion when seeing the abbrevations "ms" and "mu". Does "mu" refer to "multi-user"? It is unclear. Rather the full word "required" is being used in the context of the directory in which the plugin folder resides. It doesn't actually matter whether "required" is a plugin, or anything else, but it does matter that "required" is <em>required</em>. One can immediately sense that removing anything out of this folder would be at their own jeopardy.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>One other enhancement that fell out of tacking back and forth between the more general and the technical is that WordPress doesn't provide a great workflow "out of the box" to the process of writing, reviewing and publishing a document. That is, it provided <em>a</em> method, but not a method that would result in higher quality writing that was checked for clarity, edited for spelling mistakes and which provided references for facts that were stated. In place of this, it focused on what <em>others</em> thought in a general sense (which would likely be mostly opinion based) and on "pings" (whatever <em>they</em> are). In a scholarly sense, then, WordPress is lacking. Publishing articles in this manner <em>isn't</em> what I learned in high school and university. One could say that WordPress "ran" before it learned to "walk". In its excitment to "get content out there", it missed the fact that the content needed to be checked for quality. This isn't built in.</p>

<h2>Classification</h2>

<p>Although WordPress is typically treated informally as this is the spirit in which it is released, one soon runs into more rigourous standards when attempting to classify information and make decisions in that regard. For example, what name should a directory, term or function name have. Should it be plural or singular. Should it include an abbreviation, or not. It is better if much of this is sorted out in advance. However, in practice, this is something that is part of the historical learning process of the codebase.</p>
