<h1>Background</h1>

<p>This bundle package comes from a single source, after about eight years of development effort. That is, while nothing is perfect, the attempt has been to integrate knowledge gained into a single package, so that others can benefit from it. In addition, since the spring of 2018, work on an actual community design has also influenced this package, so that the directory structure and configuration has been set up to allow it to be used to meet the virtual needs of a compact, integrated community.</p>

<p>That is, it has been observed that most individual and companies set up their websites begining with just a single one. Well, they may have only one when they begin, but after several years, more websites may be developed. As the initial website typically occupies the root of the <code>public_html</code> folder, additional websites on the same hosting account means that they either need to be started as a <em>sub-folder</em> of the initial site, or the original site needs to be moved. This may lead to the original site breaking, so it would be preferred that this does not need to happen.</p>

<p>To help mitigate this problem, the various needs of diverse people, occupations and businesses was anticipated, so that the features any one person would be looking for would already be present in their particular folder. That is, someone in the arts will expect something entirely different from someone in the trades. Even though, from a coding standpoint, things are exactly the same (each uses HTML and PHP, for example), from the end users perspective, they would likely perceive things quite differently.</p>

What this did is to place one or two intermediate folders between the root of the site (the <code>public_hmlt</code> directory) and the folder being used. This required the use of a short server side script to "bump" the request coming in at the root of the domain to the appropriate folder. While not normally done, this is perfectly acceptable given the way that Apache is set up (arbitrarily complex).This means that, instead of having all the "eggs in one basket", there is now what I call an "incremental redundancy" in place. If one part fails, the other parts still work (as long as the server is still functioning), as the entire code sets are copies or near copies of each other. They do not funnel down to a single line of code that must work for them all, or nothing gets served. These are a few benefits.</p>

<h2>Fewer Steps</h2>

<p>One of the key aspects of building out a site is the number of steps that are needed to complete the task. The reader has probably seen the "One Click" buttons that install the platform of choice on the server for them. While handy to bypass some of the more technical aspects of connecting the site to the database and to copy the files over, almost all of these, in my experience, simply install the platform to its default settings. Thus there is still a  lot of work to do, once that installation is in place.</p>

<p>To deal with this for a single installation, a bundled package was created that then took the concept of a "One Click" install and then worked through the settings available in the WordPress administrative area. While this approach was an order of magnitude greater than the default settings, it was soon realized that different end users would require different settings, different plugins and different types of themes. Following this, work began on a actual, three dimensional community design that was also to be integrated and self-sustaining. A schematic was developed and much of this was done independently of the existing bundle package.</p>

<p>Finally, it was realized that an advantage could be gained by simple creating a set of folders that began to mimic the two dimensional schematic created for the "eco village". While not an exact match, a number of the categories created for the village were ported over to the bundle set. Since this work was done (again) partly independently, a set of about twenty folders were created to deal with most anticipated client needs that would be distinct from one another. While the eco village design focussed on two dimensional design and "the who" and "the where", the bundle package focussed on the types of setup that would be needed to handle "the who". There was not an exact match.</p>

<p>For example, a person needing a storefront to sell their products or services could be any one of a number of different types of people in the community. In many cases their needs would be identical, and the stock configuration could be similar. In the same way, goods could be sold wholesale, but there would be less expectation to complete the order online. Rather here, the focus would be on the product description and perhaps stock levels, but not as much on completing and paying for the order online. This would be done by a separate system. Working through all of these possibilities resulted in the twenty odd distinct categories created.</p>

<p>Finally, it was noticed that the word "commons" was used as the main entry point for the bundle package. This is where the word "commons" could literally be used in that sense, so that the stock theme developed, the stock set of plugins and any other components (such as images or videos) could be held as "common" to the rest of the community. However, when developing out the central point for each of the twenty odd folders, the word "center" was used. Thus, there was a "garden center", a "trade center" and a "service center". The word "center" used in this context meant almost exactly what it said. This was an unexpected outcome of this approach.</p>

<p>However, when migrating code from the "commons" folder to the other folders where "center" was used, it was noticed that the word "commons" needed to be adjusted to the word "center". It wasn't really noticed <em>why</em> this was the case, until it was realized that the word "center" worked better for categories that were <em>work</em> related, whereas the word "commons" worked better for categories that were more <em>living</em> related. The emphasis on the two dimensional schematic had been to compress it into a space suitable for a 4x6 postcard, thus the living and learning centers had been omitted, to make it graphically compact.</p>

<p>The last step is to look at both the two dimensional schematic in its entirety (which includes living, learning and working) and then compare it to what is reasonable to include as a default bundle package. There should not be any great technical difficulty in going one way or the other. However, once a direction is chosen, it should remain constant, as changes will be more difficult to make later on.</p>

<h2>Understanding WordPress</h2>

<p>WordPress was started as a blogging platform. This means that the underlying code is focussed on this task. It is also "Turing Complete". This means that it can be used to perform any programming task, given sufficient time, computational power and resources. Further, it also employs a plugin architecture that allows anyone with sufficient privileges to install any plugin, even if that plugin will be detrimental to the site as a whole.</p>

<p>In other words, one of its greatest strengths is its greatest weakness. The fact that anyone can add anything means that they do. It is up to the user to ensure they put sufficient resources into their effort that is in line with what they expect to get out of it. Even if all a person wants is a blog, the default WordPress installation still needs to be secured. Otherwise it is extremely likely it will be hacked.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find something that is truly free, easy to understand, and does exactly what is expected of it. The closest thing to free, secure and reliable might still be a lined 8 1/2" x 11" sheet of paper. To put it another way, it will be much easier to meet a person's expectation and need within an integrated community such as is being set up here, than it would to attempt to meet that same need from a distance. One can get a "free" or low cost haircut. But the results often show exactly what was received.</p>

<h2>Adjustments to the Default WordPress Configuration</h2>

<p>Although WordPress is popular, it needs a few adjustment to its default configuration to make it perform better. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making the GUID conform to the RFC 4112 UUID standard</li>
<li>Making the uploads year/month folders only when needed</li>
<li>Securing the login from brute force attacks</li>
<li>Enforcing HTTPS from the outset (new)</li>
<li>Other as needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grouped WordPress Plugins</h2>

<p>Given that the starting point was WordPress, and that the WordPress platform is so popular and has a heavy reliance on plugins, the plugins in this bundle package have been carefully grouped. These groupings include: base, developer, import, maintenance, security, social, monitor, theme and write, in alphabetical order. If a particular grouping is not needed, then it is easier to find and delete them. Integrated with this approach is a plugin which creates a list of all the plugins that are on the site and saves it as an array in a separate file. Then the DNA plugin can take that list to reconstruct the site if needed. I am not aware of these features being available anywhere else.</p>

<h2>Three Stage Fallback</h2>

<p>"Three Stage Fallback" means here that there is a three level redundancy built in. Moving backwards from the expected WordPress installation is a much simpler three file set that assembles the template parts and then delivers them, usually in under a millisecond. This means that this approach can handle 1,000 requests per second. In contrast, the overhead WordPress ships with allows it to only handle about eight requests per second; much less. One step simpler is just the straight HTML file. That is, normally WordPress plugins cache HTML files somewhere deep in the <code>wp-content</code> folder. To get at those deeply buried files requires a script in the <code>.htaccess</code> file. However, the default configuration <em>allows</em> for the direct retreival of files or images, if the exist.</p>

<p>By placing complete static files in the location where they appear in the URL of the browser, the WordPress CMS is not even needed, once these files are placed there. For example, <code>https://www.examnple.ca/page/about/</code> will retrieve the <code>index.html</code> placed at <code>public_html/page/about/index.html</code>, without any additional effort needed. If this practice is followed throughout the site, then the WordPress core could be non-functional or not even present, and the site will still work. This is as it should be, as this is how the protocol was designed. Put simply, use only what is needed and don't use anymore than is needed.</p>

<h2>Released Late in the Cycle</h2>

<p>Some developers release early and release often. The hope is that, for this method, the features can be used. As they are used there are tested, and so can be refined.  If the product is paid, the developers then have a source of income to support them in further development. The downside to this approach is that the wrong tack may have been taken at the beginning. This can lead to deprecated code, which can then be a frustration for the developer who is using the code set as a base for their own products. In reality, it is difficult, if not impossible to develop a code set to the point of maturity so that it will never have to be changed in the future. This is highly unlikely.</p>

<p>However, there is a difference between waiting until one is reasonably sure that the approach taken is valid and one has had a chance to use it in a number of different settings. Another difference here is that this code set is now being developed to help support a physical, 3D community. This is quite different from most codesets I am familiar with, in which the developer may be at least partly divorced from the physical, 3D world and then do things in such a way so that the end user finds the approach difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Indeed, one of the mindsets used as this package was developed, was attempting to see things from the end user's point of view. That is, it doesn't really matter what the developer knows or what incredibly complicated code that has been developed, what matters is how well the end user will perceive and understand it. If the same thing can be done in such a way that it is understood by the so called "average" person, then that understanding should lead to a much more robust and stable code set.</p>

<p>This was achieved to an extent in that a lot of work was done with the directory structure. All the possible uses were anticipated and then arranged in a 2D layout so that the directory structure reflected something logical, something that made sense. Although containing a lot of information, it resulted in a layering of directories that would not have been thought essential before. That is, the actual <em>core</em> of the platform was moved two or three layers deep, instead of being placed at the root of the directory. This allowed the <em>material</em> of the site to be placed at it's peer, or even "above" it, in the hierarchy. In this way the end user would encounter the articles, videos and images they would be working with <em>first</em> or <em>beside</em> the core, rather than having to navigate through the core codeset to reach their destination.</p>

<h2>Integration as Features are Added</h2>

<p>It was consisently found that as one part of a site was adjusted, other aspects of the site were affected in a way that could not have been anticipated. In practice this results in sites that are not secure, or that are not optimized. WordPress allows plugins to be added without restriction, so that it is up to the person adding the plugins to ensure they have got the right ones and that it is doing what they intend. This is no easy task, as often it takes someone with the skills of a developer to check the quality of the code, determine how secure it is and whether or not it wil slow down the site or reduce its page speed score.</p>

<p>As the bulk of the plugins already added in this package have been checked for code quality and optimization, this should be less of an issue. If a needed plugin is noticed to add more CSS or JavaScript than is needed, this can be fixed by integrating that CSS or JavaScript into other, existing plugins, or directly into the theme. Often there is a choice of two or three plugins available for major tasks. If so, the best one can be selected. In other cases, the plugin may only add a few lines of code to achieve the intended result. If this is the case, then that code can be added to a plugin which includes a broader featue set, or it can be added to the theme's <code>function.php</code> file.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Late in the process of developing this package I was finally able to understand SSL protocols that much better. It has always been important, but a barrier to implementing SSL on a broader basis has been its cost. When the cost of adding security is greater than the cost of hosting multiple, if not unlimited sites, one thinks twice about adding it, especially if it is not being deemed essential. However, it is now being considered as an essential. At the same time Let's Encrypt has made it possible to implement for free or for a much lower administrative fee than having to pay for the certificate as a separate item. While Let's Encrypt only covers domain based certificates, in many cases, this is enough to get people started. Because of this transition, this package will be setup with https as a default. Http could still be used, but settings would have to be changed to make this happen.</p> 

<h2>Meeting Recommended Standards</h2>

<p>Standards have been set for HTTP, CSS and Javascript as to the formatting, the number of files that should be loaded and where they should be loaded. Given that these are reasonable standards and not difficult to implement, they will be adhered to in the default configuration. This means no more than two CSS files. No (or minimal) inline CSS and not much more than two or three Javascript files (including jQuery). The bundle package will be self contained in the sense that it will serve all required files from it, rather than relying on a third party source (such as for jQuery). In this way it will <em>always</em> work, whereas if a reliance was placed on a third party source, and that source change, that feature set would stop working.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<p>Workflow is important in that it helps us complete a task with less effort and greater assurance that we have completed the right steps and not left anything out. When a code base is designed by a developer who is writing or maintaining the code with less oversight on what has to happen in an abstract sense (such as workflow), then the result may be something like the WordPress experience. The default is to click the "Publish" button and then have the post appear publically. While this makes sense based on the fact that many people may have trouble with extra steps needed to do so, this can easily result in poor quality writing appearing on the internet.</p>

<p>In my own experience, if I don't publish when I have finished writing, I may forget about that post, come back later and not know where it is.  The other side of the coin is that many people simply do not have the luxury of being able to submit their writing through a peer review process, even if that means only one other person looks at what they have just written.  Thus, while WordPress achieves its objective of making the web a more democratic place to be by freely giving people the tools they need to publish their ideas, making this process one step <em>too</em> easy means their is more poor quality writing on the web, including simple spelling mistakes. Thus a plugin is included to address that issue.</p>

<h2>Standardization</h2>

<p>Standardization is important as an aid in understanding and usability. When plugins are made by multiple authors at different periods in time, when standards or technology were different and when coming from different countries and different languages, there will automatically be differences in approach. This may have to do with code syntax, naming conventions or the type and number of language files included.  There may also be minor adjustments that can be made to a plugin to make it more secure, to make it more readable, or to make it more useable with the other plugins included.  This is a benefit of developing a package as a whole, rather than trying to recreate the wheel from parts that have changed since the last time they were used.</p>

<h2>Localization</h2>

<p>By the time the blimp is constructed that is of sufficient size to lift the population off of the planet, a thousand years may have passed. While it is tempting as a developer "to keep going", till the codebase that has been constructed can do just that, one way in which the entire thing can be "reined in" is to recognize the location in which it is being developed and those nearby who would use it.  As this codebase is being constructed in the Eastern Time Zone in an English speaking country, the emphasis will be on that locale and that language.</p>

<p>Some plugins come with twenty or more language files. While this is useful for the person who speaks that language to be able to understand what the plugin does, for those who <em>don't</em> use that language, it just means more files to upload via FTP or delete via FTP (if that is the case). To help pare down the number of files, all language files that are not expected to be used in the locale being developed are deleted. If needed, they can be reinstated from the origiinal plugin source.</p>

<h2>Audio Clip</h2>

<p>I had this audio clip made up by a voice over recording artist. I thought the results were exceptional, and am including it here for review.</p>

<audio controls src="/commons/media/audio/integrated-framework-jd-300-words.mp3"></audio>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although there is a lot that goes into setting up a site, it is easier to do things the hard way, in my experience. That is, there are two different types of work.  The first type of work is wondering <em>what</em> happened and how to do it. The second type of work is setting things up as an in assembly line and just continuing the process of churning out the widgets until the task is complete. Although there may be more <em>total</em> work involved, in fact it is much more peaceful and relaxed, as one is simply going through a predetermined number of steps, rather than trying to troubleshoot at every step.</p>
